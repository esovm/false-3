False Programming Language
==========================

An implementation of the False Programming Language for the Multiple project.


Specification
-------------

The implementation referenced the document from the designer 
which can be downloaded at:
http://strlen.com/false/false.txt

Should have implemented almost all features, except some operators that
use some western european characters that I don't know what to replace
with.
